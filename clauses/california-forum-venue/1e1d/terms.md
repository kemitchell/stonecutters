- **Agreed Courts** means any court of the State of California sitting in _Venue City_ and the United States District Court for the district encompassing it.

- **Lawsuit** means a legal proceeding against a party related to this agreement.

- Any party bringing any _Lawsuit_ will bring that _Lawsuit_ in the _Agreed Courts_.

- Each party consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the _Agreed Courts_, but that exclusive jurisdiction will not prohibit enforcement of any judgment obtained in that forum or any other appropriate forum.

- Each party waives any objection to venue for a _Lawsuit_ in the _Agreed Courts_ and any claim that a _Lawsuit_ brought in the _Agreed Courts_ is brought in an inconvenient forum.
