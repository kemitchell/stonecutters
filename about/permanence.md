title: Permanence

As a general rule, once a version of a clause gets published on stonecutters.law, it stays there, accessible by its [permalink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink), and does not change.  That version of the clause _will not be deleted_ and its substantive content _will not change_.  If new versions of the clause come out later, they'll be published under new version numbers.  The old versions will remain accessible.

The purpose of this policy is to allow others to link to, cite, and incorporate every version of every clause on stonecutters.law by reference.  If terms could change willy-nilly, without warning, no competent counselor would do that.

As an example, the [first draft of the first version of california-governing-law](https://stonecutters.law/california-governing-law/1.0.0-1), our California governing law clause, will always be available at <https://stonecutters.law/california-governing-law/1.0.0-1>. Its substantive content will not change.

When we find a way to improve on the clause, or spots an error in it, we will publish new versions of the california-governing-law clause.  The first draft of the first version will not change. If and when we become embarrassed by that first draft in the future, tough luck.  We will publish something new and better, not vainly purge our prior handiwork from history.

Those who want extra protection should consider archiving copies of stonecutters.law webpages, or using a third-party service like [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) or [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc) to do so for them.  By the by, stonecutters.law's source files are acceded to the [GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/) automatically.

Since stonecutters.law inhabits the real world, there have to be a few exceptions:

- The formatting, styling, typography, and other user interface elements of form pages will change. The plan is that they will get better. The people behind commonform.org will do their best to avoid any confusion about what is the text of the form on that page, and what is other, potentially changeable content.

- If we have to take content down to avoid legal claims, or to comply with the law, we will. For example, we may take content down under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or to avoid getting roped into somebody else's trademark suit.

Since we are but mortals, there will also be exceptions we havenâ€™t though of yet.  We will do our best to mention them here when we do.
