  - > A contract may validly include the provisions of a document not physically a part of the basic contract.  As stated in _Scott's Valley Fruit Exchange v. Growser Refrigeration Co._, 81 Cal.App.2d 437, at p. 447 [184 P.2d 183]: (Disapproved on an inapplicable point in _Hischenmoeller v. National Ice etc. Storage Co._, 46 Cal.2d 318, 328 [294 P.d 433].) "It is, of course, the law that the parties may incorporate by reference into their contract the terms of some other document. [Citations.] But each case must turn on on its facts. [Citation.] For the terms of another document to be incorporated into the document executed by the parties the reference must be clear and unequivocal, the reference must be called to the attention of the other party and he must consent thereto, and the terms of the incorporated document must be known or easily available to the contracting parties."

  - > The memorandum may consist of several writings if one of the writings is signed and the writings in the circumstances clearly indicate that they relate to the same transaction. ยง132.

  - > When two or more documents are signed by the party to be charged, they may be read together even though neither contains any reference to the other.  The question whether they constitute a sufficient memorandum is substantially the same as if they had been incorporated in a single document. Comment b.

- The fourth edition of Ken Adams' Manual of Style for Contract Drafting refers to documents incorporated into other documents as "virtual attachments".  See 5.110-5.115.  It also discourages use of the phrase "incorporated by reference".  See 13.388-13.393.

- Ken Adams, ["Language to Use When Making an Ancillary Document Part of a Contract"](https://www.adamsdrafting.com/making-an-ancillary-document-part-of-a-contract/), March 14, 2007, addressing faults in "subject to":

  -  _Affinity Internet, Inc. v. Consolidated Credit Counseling Services, Inc._, 920 So. 2d 1286 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006) ("subject to" failed to effect incorporation by reference)

  - _Pacific Vegetable Oil Corp. v. C.S.T., Ltd._, 174 P.2d 441 (Cal. 1946) ("The general reference in the contract to published rules of the association did not constitute such an incorporation.")
