<h3 id="clauses">Incorporating Clauses by Reference</h3>

You can incorporate clauses from the Stonecutters catalog by reference into your contracts and other legal terms.  The easiest and most convenient way to do this is by [permalink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink):

> _Governing Law_.  Include <https://stonecutters.law/california-governing-law/1.0.0-1>.

This unambiguously incorporates version 1.0.0-1 of the [california-governing-law](/california-governing-law) clause from the Stonecutters catalog by reference.  The [terms](/california-governing-law/1.0.0-1#terms) of that clause will never change.  If and when we find a way to improve that clause, we will publish a new version with a different version number.

Some clauses in the catalog use terms that aren't defined.  For example, this part of [california-forum-venue 1.0.0-1](/california-forum-venue/1.0.0-1) uses the term "Venue City" without defining it:

> **Agreed Courts** means any court of the State of California sitting in _Venue City_ and the United States District Court for the district encompassing it.
>
> [...]

"Venue City" works a bit like a blank that you can fill in:

> _Forum and Venue_.  Include <https://stonecutters.law/california-forum-venue/1.0.0-1> with San Francisco as Venue City.

This unambiguously incorporates the clause and also specifies that _Venue City_ is San Francisco.  If you prefer Los Angeles:

> _Forum and Venue_.  Include <https://stonecutters.law/california-forum-venue/1.0.0-1> with Los Angeles as Venue City.
